# Python and MongoDB Project for Beginners with Source Code

##  Business Overview
MongoDB is a document database used to develop highly accessible and scalable web
 applications. Its flexible schema technique is popular among agile development teams.
 With drivers for all popular programming languages, MongoDB enables you to launch
 your application immediately without wasting time setting up a database.
 MongoDB's document database architecture makes it simple for programmers to store
 both structured and unstructured data. It stores documents in a format akin to JSON.
 Since developers don't have to worry about normalizing data, this format naturally maps
 to native objects in most contemporary programming languages. MongoDB can scale
 vertically and horizontally to support heavy data loads and handle the huge volume.
  This is the second project in the MongoDB project series. In the first project, we studied
 about MongoDB database, which is essentially a NoSQL service, its basic architecture,
 the data modeling used behind MongoDB, and how querying and aggregations can be
 performed using MongoDB. We also understood the different tools supported by
 MongoDB that can be leveraged to perform various tasks like Data Analytics, ETL, and
 Data Visualization. In this project, we will understand how to use PySpark connector
 with MongoDB using Apache Sedona. We will also perform some advanced analysis
 using Ranks and Window functions.
